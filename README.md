âš¡ Fun fact: I started coding in college and loved it but graduated right after the dot-com crash and I wasn't able to find work. <sub>I am really dating myself here!</sub>

I recently started teaching myself Python and decided to splurge on a bootcamp to learn more. I graduated from the [DigitalCrafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/) Software Engineering bootcamp and am currently a Teaching Assistant for them as well!
